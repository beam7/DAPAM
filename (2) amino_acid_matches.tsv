Introduction	3	6	Sokolov and coworkers [19] carried out conductance measurements across several different types of planar phospholipid bilayers treated with protegrin-1 as well as protegrin-3 (PG3, amino RGGGLCYCRRRFCVCVGR; note the only difference between PG-1 and PG-3 is the substitution of a glycine residue at the third position in PG-3 instead of the arginine residue in PG-1).

Introduction	4	2	Among the synthetic antimicrobial peptides, KSL-W(KKVVFWVKFK-NH2) has the characteristics of lower poisonous and side effects, strong antiseptic qualities and no drug resistance during killing bacterial owing to its unique amino acid sequence [5-7], which makes it attractive candidate for drug development.	PMC9358902	KKVVFWVKFK
Introduction	3	3	One such product is the 11-mer sequence BP100 (KKLFKKILKYL-NH_2), which was developed from hybrids of cecropin and melittin (Andreu et al., 1992; Cavallarin et al., 1998; Ferre et al., 2006; Badosa et al., 2007; Ferre et al., 2009).	PMC8107365	KKLFKKILKYL

Introduction	7	1	On the other hand, the short length (11 amino acids) and high charge density (5 charges at side chains and one N-terminal), and the efficient cell uptake of BP100 is similar to some well-known and effective CPPs like for example the unstructured, short, highly cationic peptides poly-arginine, poly-lysine, or the 13 residue peptide TAT[48-60] from HIV-1 [GRKKRRQRRRPPQ] (in this paper we will just call it TAT) (Vives et al., 1997; Thorén et al., 2003).
